# rctmiss

rctmiss is a package created in conjunction with my undergraduate thesis. The package creates a basic simulation environment to explore properties of multiple imputation and missing data in a variety of settings.

# Usage

Assuming that you already have installed R and the RStudio IDE, make sure you have the devtools package installed. Then the package will be available for download using the install_github() function.

```{r}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rstudio/rctmiss")
```
